# Jobly Backend

This is the Express backend for Jobly, version 2.

## Description

This full-stack application which will be used to explore and "apply" for jobs online. This project has no intention of being for real jobs or commercial use. This is purely a personal project.

To run this app install the dependencies and run :

```
node server.js
```

## Testing

Requires a postgres database named `jobly_test`. In the top-level directory, run:

```
jest -i
```

## Technologies

This full-stack application uses a backend including Node, Express, and [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/postgres/postgres) database. The front end will uses React.

## Looking Forward

This app is currently being built.

While most of the back-end is complete, it is far from completed. React client side is currently being built and plans for additional features are in the works.
